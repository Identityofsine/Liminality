   abstract:`This radiant vista, once teeming with bipedal lifeforms who delighted in using donut-shaped PVC as a source of relaxation, as they floated along the sparkling, crystalline waters. The breeze was soft and warm, reminiscent of a balmy summer's night, the landscape blanketed in verdant blades of grass that flowed like a deep, emerald river. Graceful creatures, known as "Flutterers," moved in an eternal dance, their wings gently fluttering as they emanated a soft, bioluminescent glow.`,
   content:[{content:`Florida nights are almost never cold. Although one night in my youth the Florida air was cold as New York in the fall. I was perched on my dad’s shoulders, shivering as the cold air condensed my breath in front of me. As we walked, I laid my eyes upon a waterpark after hours. The inflatable tubes were still floating across the “lazy river”. The lazy river had large plastic red-topped mushrooms sitting beside hills as decorations. At day time, they would be relaxing and fun furniture for the ride but at night it casted an eerie sense of not belonging.

   Although I felt unnerved by the deserted water park, I said nothing and we silently made our way back to the hotel. After we had reached our room, something didn’t sit well with me. I felt as if that waterpark had a significant meaning to it or something horrifying had happened to make it so empty.
   
   Years later, I came down with a bad fever that left me in limbo between half-consciousness and delirium. My mother stripped me of all my clothes and threw me on the cool couch. I laid there feeling the emanating heat on my skin. Despite feeling exposed, I had felt like I had spent the entire day out in the scolding sun. I eventually gave way and drifted off to sleep.
   
   I started to dream of a place similar to the waterpark complete with the same large plastic red-topped mushrooms that were placed along the river. The sun had set and although the sky was beginning to be dark, the park was well lit. Despite its intended atmosphere, there weren’t any people at the park. There actually weren't any signs of life there, there was no litter or left-behind belongings. It didn’t have the typical signs of abandonment, the place was obviously kept up with running water but it felt like nobody had been here before, at least not for a while. 
   
   I decided to walk up to the plastic mushroom tree and feel it. Despite its plastic appearance the stem had a coarse texture that gave easily under my hand. Looking up at the cap there was nothing but darkness, I wondered if there was a clear volume to the cap or if it was just hard to see past the void. 
   
   The water running through the river was an unnatural perfect crystal blue and It put me off. I moved away from the water's edge and continued along the riverbank. The plastic mushroom trees stopped appearing and it was just hilly grass from there on out. 
   
   Suddenly I notice a sign posted next to the water. Its placement is innocuous to the continuity of the river but it certainly didn’t make much sense to have it there. It was a white sign with bolded text in the center of it. It was very similar to a Speed Limit Sign in the United States. At first the text was illegible, then out of seemingly nowhere it said “You are Alone.” I continued my journey along the river without thought.
   
    I had noticed that the night sky was reflecting off the water (with the very little light there was). I went on my knees and tried to see my own reflection. I saw nothing, I might have blended in with the night sky(for it being so dark) but I atleast should've seen my own shadow. For a moment I thought I was dead and entered my own hell. I got up and moved along the river.
   
   Eventually the river curved along a big hill where a house was sitting on. Just like the park, the house was mysteriously lit and its color was clear. It was a sharp gray one story house with a roof that faced the sides of the house(as if a child were to draw a house). 
   
   I hadn’t paid attention to the grass, but as I climbed the hill, I noticed the grass wasn’t real. It was the same fake grass they use at golf courses near the hole. It was fake, bright green, and soft on my feet. 
   
   The windows looked black, but I could see the reflection of the river and sky in the glass. The door had no concavity in its texture, it was extremely flat but the normal groves and divots were painted on. Even the door knob was a mere painted illusion. The door would only look right from one angle and one angle only. Despite the evidence that this house is just a prop I try to push on the fake door to see if it would hinge open. The texture of the door felt like wrapping paper and it easily gave way to my push. 
   
   It was completely black, there wasn’t any trace of light, any discernible silhouette and it reeked of cardboard. I put my left foot in first and immediately fell into a void. My entire vision was filled with black and I felt the wind brace against my face. My mouth was open but it was impossible to breathe. I closed my eyes tight in fear and then as If it weren’t happening at all, I was no longer falling. I was on my feet.
   
   The room was lit up by one warm light bulb. The concrete walls and floor were weathered with wear and tare. In between these small holes there was graffiti and writing throughout the entire room. All in red paint. Some words were screaming while others were calm. I tried to focus on a few markings at once : “Empty”, “Nobody”, “Understand”, “Unaccepting”, “Alone”, “Enjoyless”, “Solitary”, “Force Withdraw”. 
   
   I shortly discovered that there weren't any doors, any hatches, or escapes. It was air-tight like a glass container (but now made out of concrete). I frantically searched, jutting my head in all sorts of directions. The words started to grow and suffocate me and the concrete. The concrete was now covered in one big red mess. Before waking up, I focused on a white blotch on the red wall. It was the sign I saw earlier: “You Are Alone.”

   content:[{content:`The grass was green when the sun was beating down on my jet black hair. I could feel the wood chips from the playground prick the bottom of my heel everytime I walked. There were two playgrounds divided by a couple feet of dirt. One was an old, aged, wooden playground that heavily relied on tires for juvenile entertainment. Next to it was a bright purple plastic palace that stood taller but was bereft of features. Depending on your playstyle, you would strictly stick to one playground. The rougher kids would play at the splinter prone wooden playground and the more calm and less active kids would play -- hangout really -- at the plastic palace. 

   The purple playground was constructed with water bottle plastic, its floor was a thick black sheet metal covered with a hole punched pattern. During the summer, the sun would beat down on the black floor but the holes would allow air to flow and be habitable for sitting. Me and the other kids were galloping across the tires on the wooden playground, many of us would fall deep into the tire made net and end up scathing our knees and inner thighs; but since we were kids we would ignore the pain and continue in our affair of fun. After a few hops with my childhood friends, I exited the fun machine and began to make distance with them. None of them had noticed that I walked away so I felt this was a perfect time to excuse myself. In a mix of exhaustion and boredom, I made my way to the purple playground. 
   
   When I was younger, I was never in a state of search. I wouldn’t be looking for somebody to talk to or play with, I was endlessly curious and I wanted to see what was waiting for me. When I got up there, there were two kids sitting down. One was a girl and the other a boy. The boy and I happened to be a year younger than the girl. She had braces and dirty blond hair. Her clothes looked cheap and her fingernails were long and unpainted. Her young arms had a shadow of hair across them and she seemed masculine in nature. 
   
   They were talking to each other about the girl moving onto middle school in a couple of months. She wasn’t ready for the switch and she seemed stressed. In retrospect, there was a good chance that I was witnessing the first time this girl had ever felt real stress in her life. In hindsight, that wasn’t true; I wasn’t witnessing anything in that moment at all. I glided between both of their eyes and I mustered up a “Hey!” to them. The girl’s face scrunched as if I were violating her privacy, ruining her intimate moment. The boy looked up and nodded his head at me. I wouldn’t say I am friends with the kid, I don’t even know his name; but he's one of those people you frequently see. You never exchange names but at some point both of you start to associate each other as “that guy”.
   
   “What are you guys talking about?” I said, trying to meddle into their conversation. 
   
   “Mind your bee’s wax.” she said hissingly. I took a step back and my eyes danced between the floor and their faces.
   
    “Relax. She’s going into middle school next year and she's upset.”, the boy confessed, “Don’t take it personal”. 
   
   She says “I am not upset! I’m just…”, while looking down into the right.
   
   The boy turns his head away from the girl and onto me, “Well, whatever it is, don’t worry about it.”, he scoots over and offers me a seat, patting his hand softly on the metal floor on his left. 
   
   I felt like Adam after he ate the apple. Something about sitting down next to him felt wrong morally. I sat down softly without trying to upset the floor. My mouth opened with hesitation and I managed to ask the boy for his name.
   
   “It’s hunt, and this is Elma. It’s very nice to meet you.”
   
   My tonality resembled a constant question as I replied, “Hunt? I never heard of that name; is there any special meaning to it?”
   
   “No, my dad just really likes to hunt.”, He chuckled lightly and his smile faded away as quick as it came.
   
   We heard a whistle blow loud and I jerked my neck to see the dozens of kids racing a 100 yards to get back to the class. 
   
   Hunt looks towards me, “You know they can’t see us from here.” 
   
   Elma joins with “Yea, watch they won’t even know we're gone”.
   
   The whistle blows for a second time and then finally all the kids are lined up and they start marching their way into the building. 
   
   My experience felt surreal as I saw them enter one by one. I felt like a fugitive in the act of his crime. It’s important to know that my class would be the last one to have recess; after a quick 45 minute debrief we would be sent home. 
   
   I had a few reasons other than peer pressure to not go back. For one, there would be no excuse for me to return to class after the others, they were all lined up and counted -- they would know I was gone before I had begun my journey back. A red alert would be called and a search party would find me here, relaxing on a playground.
   
   “You see how little we matter to them? Nothing would have changed if we lined up with the rest of them, instead of sitting here we would be sitting in the classroom where the teacher's eyes always glided past us. Never giving us the light of day.” Elma abruptly said with passion. 
   
   “No, they always do a head count, they’d never forget anyone…”, I said with meekness in my voice.
   
   “Oh, grow up. There are 32 kids in each class, 32 different lives with 2 parents each. A teacher has to worry about 96 people in total -- give or take some kids have single moms. But regardless, you think that they will go a-wall for one measly kid? ”
   
   Hunt cut her off, “You are putting way too much on him too fast. Step on wet concrete and you ruin the cure.”
   
   I felt like I should have said something. To put it short, I was speechless. All of the cards that I could play were bad and led to terrible endings. In hindsight, I chose the best choice which was not playing any card at all and staying mute.
   
   “Hey. Remember, she’s still cranky about middle school. Let her blow off all that steam.” Hunt smiles and he asks me, “Don’t you think this is cool?” 
   
   “What?” 
   
   “This. Where we are now. On this playground while they are inside.”
   
   “Can’t say I have, Hunt. Aren’t we going to get in trouble?” 
   
   Hunt laughs, “C'mon kid don’t be dumb. If we knew they couldn’t see us we'd have to have done this before without getting caught. And besides, they don’t care.”
   
   “I told you, look no one has came for us, they don’t fucking care.”, yelled Elma. 
   
     Her nihilistic words started to go in one ear and out the other as she was insistent that the school and its officials lacked any regard for its students. That it was just an assembly line for them to make money and them to pump out conditioned slaves forced to work for love. Hunt seemed to be more relaxed about the entire thing. He carried a strong but relaxed posture and breathed in such a calm way that you would have thought he was sleeping.
   
     “Here’s what Elma's really talking about. We believe that teachers are paid to like us. To ‘love us’. We are only looked after so their asses are covered if anything happens to us. So, in the case that something does happen; we end up drunks, bums, and criminals, they could always say ‘we cared for them the best we could. I never saw this coming, he was such a good kid!’ But don’t get twisted, some teachers work in vain and try to create their own prodiges. Try to create us into what they couldn’t be.”
   
   “I wouldn’t think like us if I was you”, he chuckles, “we are just as clueless as you are”. 
   
   I sat up and leaned my upper back against the wall that connected the playground and the slide. I was still speechless, my face had felt white. Elma had softened her face, she was sitting with her hands behind her body propping her up. Hunt was sitting down like I was but instead he was hugging his knee to use as a stilt and he looked like one big lung breathing fully in and out.
   
   By the time Hunt told me their ideology 30 minutes went by. Nobody came into the playground looking for us. School is about to end in 15 minutes and they haven’t thought to check the playground… Did they know we were here? Did they know we were gone? What Elma said before started to make sense and I understood her frustration. 
   
   Despite my naivety at that moment, it clicked that what Elma was saying wasn’t out of spite for the teachers. But that she felt utterly unimportant, meaningless and just another ear to teach. I think she sat out here because she wanted someone to come look for her. To claim that they were worried sick and they are so grateful to have found her. 
   
   Finally a man comes out of the doors closest to the gate. The gate was a large fenced structure that would be closed a little bit before school was closed. 
   
   “See, he was looking right at us and just walked away.”, Elma says.
   
   Hunt turns his head away from Elma and focuses on me. “Have you ever been lost before?”
   
   “Lost? I’ve been lost in a store and like a mall once.”
   
   
   “I don’t mean lost like that. I mean lost where you were gone for days. Where nobody had a clue where you were so they called the police. A whole party looking for you and all of them would throw their hats in the air if you were to be discovered again. The feeling of being lost is so free; there’s no restrictions and no worries. You are ultimately free. And as long as you're missing, they will long for you. And if you are never found, those people will love you until they meet the god who lost their son.”
   
   I didn’t know how to respond. My mouth was ajar and my breath was quick. 
   
   “You don’t understand yet, and that’s fine. But take in the moment. This moment we are in right now because my friend, you’re technically lost.”
   
   Elma smirks at me as Hunt takes a deep breath. In the corner of my eye, I see the bright yellow buses that were lined up for dismal -- they get there around the start of recess -- drive off with their lights flashing. The parents walked steadily with their version of an angel next to them. Soon there was nothing and nobody.  
   
   The fact that I am trapped here after school is starting to set in and this eerie feeling is setting in. I was stuck with two lost causes and no clear way of getting home. I had begun to feel lost.
   
   “Guys, how do we get out of here?” I urgently said.
   
   “What’s the rush? School just ended. Nowhere is as important as the spot you are in now.” Hunt says.
   
   Elma sits up and looks at me with somber eyes, “Give it 10 minutes love and the entire school will be empty, maybe a few custodians here and there but you should be okay going through the school to get to the north exit.”
   
   “I don’t want to go in there alone… Can you guys come with me, please?”
   
    Hunt laughs. He laughs and laughs with increasing intensity. Elma’s somber remains and she looks down, her eyes start to glisten as if she were about to cry. He suddenly stops his laughter and gets up. He grabs Elma’s hand forcefully and pulls her up. Without saying a word, they begin to walk down the steps of the purple playground -- leaving paradise. Elma turns her head to look at me and her wet eyes glisten and her brown eyes give me a depth of melancholy that can only be described as infinite. They start to walk towards the wooden playground, I hear their feet leave the wood chips that covered the ground of Purple Paradise and into the rocky mess that complimented the wood playground. 
   
     After they had walked far enough to where I couldn’t see them, I picked myself up slowly. I didn’t notice until then but my leg was numb and I had to limp down the stairs. Once I stepped on the wood chips, I locked eyes with the gymnasium door and started my pursuit. The door was large and brick colored -- although it was obviously made out of metal. I grabbed the silver handle and I pulled the door. Surprisingly the door was heavy, really heavy. I only managed to yank it open enough to fit my little body through. The polished waxed gym floors stunk a urine yellow and the skylights gave the gym a warm temperature in color. The sound of my sneakers squeaking against the floor echoed and each iteration of squeak would bring more unease to my heart. It didn’t make sense why my sneakers would squeak, I hadn’t stepped in anything wet; there was obviously something wet on the floor.
   
     Once I walked into the hallway I saw nobody. Not a soul in sight. 
   I had a strong sense of unease, I knew, I absolutely knew that I shouldn’t be here. I felt like a prisoner who was roaming his cell as a freeman. Something struck my heart hard, I had realized that my parents were supposed to pick me up after school had ended. My thoughts raced : What did they do when they didn’t find me? Did they go and look for me? Did they just assume I was going to come home eventually? Were they happy I was gone? Relieved? I was starting to understand Elma and Elma more. 
   
   I didn’t feel like anything Hunt told me I would feel. I was lost but no one was looking for me. He enjoyed the fame and I hated the obscurity.
   
     I headed towards the middle of the building, where the auditorium slept. The auditorium hadn't changed since the building was constructed in 1932. It is entirely original. I had wanted to see what the Auditorium looked like when it was empty. The paint on the podium was peeling, and the tiled floors were starting to show serious age. It reeked with a stench of water damaged wood, and it generally gave me more feelings of discomfort than anything. There were large red curtains covering the windows, very little light bled into the room. And I couldn’t help but relate to the large room. I had left the auditorium and made my way towards the north end of the school.
   
     I had finally found the doors that lead to the exit that we would normally go out of. Typically you would either walk to the right and find your bus or you would see your mom or dad waiting for you with a slight smile on their face. The two doors were similar to the gymnasium but instead of being a solid block of metal it had two windows stacked on top of each other. I pushed onto the latch and I exited the school into the free world. I could feel the pressure difference as the wind glided across my face. 
   
   But as quickly as I felt the wind an impending doom had set in. There wasn’t anyone waiting for me. Not my parents, not the principal, nobody. I wasn’t lost in the traditional sense of the word. For something to be lost it has to be looked for. 
   
   And in that moment I felt like Elma. I understood her pain and her spite towards teachers. It wasn’t about the teachers at all, she was forgotten. A bastard child who designated herself to rest at the playground with some narcissist who takes pleasure in being searched for. Hunt had what Elma wanted. 
   
   At once, I aligned my thoughts with Elma and our pain was one and I could even feel her worry about starting middle school -- but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered in that moment other than the fact that I was forgotten.
