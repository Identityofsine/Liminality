   content:`Florida nights are almost never cold. Although one night in my youth the Florida air was cold as New York in the fall. I was perched on my dad’s shoulders, shivering as the cold air condensed my breath in front of me. As we walked, I laid my eyes upon a waterpark after hours. The inflatable tubes were still floating across the “lazy river”. The lazy river had large plastic red-topped mushrooms sitting beside hills as decorations. At day time, they would be relaxing and fun furniture for the ride but at night it casted an eerie sense of not belonging.

   Although I felt unnerved by the deserted water park, I said nothing and we silently made our way back to the hotel. After we had reached our room, something didn’t sit well with me. I felt as if that waterpark had a significant meaning to it or something horrifying had happened to make it so empty.
   
   Years later, I came down with a bad fever that left me in limbo between half-consciousness and delirium. My mother stripped me of all my clothes and threw me on the cool couch. I laid there feeling the emanating heat on my skin. Despite feeling exposed, I had felt like I had spent the entire day out in the scolding sun. I eventually gave way and drifted off to sleep.
   
   I started to dream of a place similar to the waterpark complete with the same large plastic red-topped mushrooms that were placed along the river. The sun had set and although the sky was beginning to be dark, the park was well lit. Despite its intended atmosphere, there weren’t any people at the park. There actually weren't any signs of life there, there was no litter or left-behind belongings. It didn’t have the typical signs of abandonment, the place was obviously kept up with running water but it felt like nobody had been here before, at least not for a while. 
   
   I decided to walk up to the plastic mushroom tree and feel it. Despite its plastic appearance the stem had a coarse texture that gave easily under my hand. Looking up at the cap there was nothing but darkness, I wondered if there was a clear volume to the cap or if it was just hard to see past the void. 
   
   The water running through the river was an unnatural perfect crystal blue and It put me off. I moved away from the water's edge and continued along the riverbank. The plastic mushroom trees stopped appearing and it was just hilly grass from there on out. 
   
   Suddenly I notice a sign posted next to the water. Its placement is innocuous to the continuity of the river but it certainly didn’t make much sense to have it there. It was a white sign with bolded text in the center of it. It was very similar to a Speed Limit Sign in the United States. At first the text was illegible, then out of seemingly nowhere it said “You are Alone.” I continued my journey along the river without thought.
   
    I had noticed that the night sky was reflecting off the water (with the very little light there was). I went on my knees and tried to see my own reflection. I saw nothing, I might have blended in with the night sky(for it being so dark) but I atleast should've seen my own shadow. For a moment I thought I was dead and entered my own hell. I got up and moved along the river.
   
   Eventually the river curved along a big hill where a house was sitting on. Just like the park, the house was mysteriously lit and its color was clear. It was a sharp gray one story house with a roof that faced the sides of the house(as if a child were to draw a house). 
   
   I hadn’t paid attention to the grass, but as I climbed the hill, I noticed the grass wasn’t real. It was the same fake grass they use at golf courses near the hole. It was fake, bright green, and soft on my feet. 
   
   The windows looked black, but I could see the reflection of the river and sky in the glass. The door had no concavity in its texture, it was extremely flat but the normal groves and divots were painted on. Even the door knob was a mere painted illusion. The door would only look right from one angle and one angle only. Despite the evidence that this house is just a prop I try to push on the fake door to see if it would hinge open. The texture of the door felt like wrapping paper and it easily gave way to my push. 
   
   It was completely black, there wasn’t any trace of light, any discernible silhouette and it reeked of cardboard. I put my left foot in first and immediately fell into a void. My entire vision was filled with black and I felt the wind brace against my face. My mouth was open but it was impossible to breathe. I closed my eyes tight in fear and then as If it weren’t happening at all, I was no longer falling. I was on my feet.
   
   The room was lit up by one warm light bulb. The concrete walls and floor were weathered with wear and tare. In between these small holes there was graffiti and writing throughout the entire room. All in red paint. Some words were screaming while others were calm. I tried to focus on a few markings at once : “Empty”, “Nobody”, “Understand”, “Unaccepting”, “Alone”, “Enjoyless”, “Solitary”, “Force Withdraw”. 
   
   I shortly discovered that there weren't any doors, any hatches, or escapes. It was air-tight like a glass container (but now made out of concrete). I frantically searched, jutting my head in all sorts of directions. The words started to grow and suffocate me and the concrete. The concrete was now covered in one big red mess. Before waking up, I focused on a white blotch on the red wall. It was the sign I saw earlier: “You Are Alone.”

   content:`The grass was green when the sun was beating down on my jet black hair. I could feel the wood chips from the playground prick the bottom of my heel everytime I walked. There were two playgrounds separated by a mere yard of dirt. One was an old, aged, wooden playground that heavily relied on tires for juvenile entertainment. Next to it was a bright purple plastic playground that stood taller but less featureful. Kids would congregate themselves according to their current playstyle, the rough kids would go to the wooden playground and the relaxed ones would stay at the purple. 

   The black sheet of metal with a hole gridded pattern acted as the floor for the purple playground. It dissipated enough heat in the summer to make it comfortable enough to sit down. In a mix of exhaustion and boredom, I made my way to the purple playground. When I was younger, I was never in a state of search. I wasn’t searching for somebody to talk to or play with, I was endlessly curious and I wanted to see what was waiting for me. When I got up there, two kids were sitting down. One was a girl and the other a boy, me and the boy happened to be a year younger than the girl. She had braces and dirty blond hair. Her clothes looked cheap and her fingernails were long and unpainted. Her young arms had a shadow of hair across them and she seemed masculine in nature. 
   
   They were talking to each other about the girl moving onto middle school in a couple of months. She wasn’t ready for the switch and she seemed stressed. There’s a good chance that I am witnessing the first time this girl has had stress put on her wellbeing. I looked into her pained eyes for a moment and could see the fear she had. Even though I was a year younger, I could not relate to her woes. I mustered up a “Hey!” to them. The girl’s face scrunched as if I were violating her privacy. The boy looked up and nodded his head at me. I wouldn’t say I am friends with the kid, I don’t even know his name; but he's one of those people you frequently see without knowing. At some point you capture a mental image of that person and you start to know them as that. That kid who always wears black or that guy who always wears a hat. 
   
   “What are you guys talking about?” I said, trying to meddle into their conversation. 
   
   “Mind your bee’s wax.” the girl said hissingly. I took a step back and darted my eyes down to the hole patterned metal floor.
   
    “Relax. She’s going into middle school next year and she's upset.”, the boy confessed, “Don’t take it personal”. 
   
   “I am not upset! I’m just…” 
   
   “Well, whatever it is, don’t worry about it.”, he moves over and offers me a seat nodding his head towards his left. I felt naked walking towards the boy. 
   
   Trying to make conversation I asked the boy for his name and he told me it was Hunt. Even now I thought hunt was a very interesting name to have. And I let him know that, he laughed a bit and said his dad liked to hunt. 
   
   Eventually the lunch ladies started to blow the whistle to try to rally us up so we could go back to class. 
   
   Hunt looks towards me, “You know they can’t see us from here.” 
   Elma joins with “Yea, watch they won’t even know we're gone”.
   
   The whistle blows for a second time and then finally all the kids are lined up and they start marching their way into the building. 
   I had never been out of bounds like this before and I felt like a criminal eluding class like this. In my mind, it was too late to run back into the building and there would be no possible excuse for my absence. I decided to stay here with these delinquents as we were now fugitives on the run. 
   
   We had our recess near the end of the day so we’d be the last ones to play on the playground, there wouldn’t be another adult coming out to the playground until it was time to close the gate at sunset. Elma looks at me with razor sharp eyes.
   
   “You see how little we matter to them? Nothing would have changed if we lined up with the rest of them, instead of sitting here we would be sitting in the classroom where the teacher's eyes always glided past us. Never giving us the light of day.”
   
   “No I don’t think that is, I think my teacher likes me”, I said meekly. 
   
   “Grow up. Do you really think she likes you? Just think about your entire class, does she like everyone in your class just as much as you? If she doesn’t like one kid as much as the other, what makes a good kid good and a bad one bad to her?”
   
   “You are putting way too much on him too fast. You are stepping on wet concrete, you are going to ruin the cure.” said Hunt.
   
   I want to say something but everything I could think of could not match what I just heard. All of the cards I could play were bad and my best move was not to play at all. Her feelings of unjust paired with my feelings of being a fugitive were too much in one moment. 
   
   “Remember, she’s still cranky about middle school. Let her blow off steam as much as she can.” Hunt smiles and he asks me, “Don’t you think this is cool?” 
   
   “What?” I said meekly. 
   
   “This. Have you ever been at recess when your class was inside churning like a gear for a machine?”
   
   “Can’t say I have” 
   
   “I told you, look no one has came for us, they don’t fucking care.”, Yelled Elma. 
     At this point of my life, I rarely heard curse words and to hear it from a girl older than me sparked wonder and inspiration. Her nihilistic words started to go in one ear and out the other as she was insistent that the school and its officials lacked any regard for its students. That it was just a machine for them to make money and them to pump out slaves bound by longing for love and acceptance. Hunt seemed to be more relaxed in the events surrounding him. He carried a strong but relaxed posture and breathed in a way that only those sleeping could. 
   
     “What Elma's really talking about is our idea that teachers are paid to like us. To ‘love us’. That we are only cared for so their asses are covered if anything happens to us, so in the case that something does they could say we cared for them the best we could. That is not to say that all teachers are like this but they wouldn’t be here without the money.”
   
   “I wouldn’t think like us”, he chuckles, “we are just trying to understand like you are right now”. 
   
   I stood up and leaned my upper back against the wall that braced the border between playground and slide. I was still speechless, my face had felt white. Elma had softened her face, she was sitting back with her hands propping her upper-body up and her legs spread across. Hunt was sitting down like I was but instead he was hugging his knee to use as a stilt and he looked like one big lung breathing slowly in and out.
   
   30 Minutes Go By and Nothing. No one comes for us and school ends shortly. Before school ends they lock up the gate to the playground, I never knew why they did this but it has something to do with unauthorized adults entering the playground (I’m pretty sure there was a story where a child predator snuck passed the open gate and attempted to lure a kid into grabbing distance.  
   
   A man wearing gray jeans and a collared shirt with white underneath came out near the gate and closed it. We notice him but he doesn’t notice us.
   
   “See, he was looking right at us and just walked away.”, Elma says.
   
   Hunt turns to his left and asks me if I had ever been lost before. I replied with “sure, a few times in the store”.
   
   “I don’t mean like lost for a few minutes or maybe an hour. I mean lost for days where nobody could find you and people are out looking for you? The feeling of being lost is so free; no restrictions and no worries. The only people who are really trying to find you are your folks, as long as you are lost they will always love you.”
   
   “No I can’t say I have. And I don’t think I want to be lost anyway.” I replied.
   
   “You don’t understand yet, and that’s fine. To be fair you are lost right now.”
   
   Elma smirks at me as Hunt takes another deep breath. I see the buses that were lined up for dismal leave with the parents picking up their kids. The fact that I am trapped here after school is starting to set in and this eerie feeling of heat exhaustion is setting in. 
   
   “How are we going to get home guys?” I said, urgently. 
   
   “No need. Be lost or get Lost.” Hunt says.
   
   “Give it 10 minutes love and the entire school will be empty, maybe a few custodians here and there but you have to go inside to get out.”, shockingly coming from Elma. 
   
   “You guys got me into this mess, help me get out!”, and Hunt laughs. He laughs and laughs with increasing intensity. Elma’s face is blank and stoic. He stops his laughter suddenly and gets up. He grabs Elma’s hand, pulls her up and begins to walk down the steps of the purple playground. They go towards the wooden playground out of sight. I don’t follow them, I don’t want anything to do with them.
   
     After they had reached their destination, I picked myself up slowly and began to walk. I had a limp because my leg had been numb from sitting on a vein for too long. I awkwardly climb down the stairs and make it for the gymnasium door. I pulled the door and it gave very little; it wasn’t locked but extremely heavy. I yanked it open and only enough came out to fit my little body through the cracks. The polished waxed gym floors stunk a yellow color and the skylights flooded the room with a warm yellow. The sound of my sneakers squeaking against the floor echoed and each iteration of squeak would bring more unease to my heart.
   
     There was nobody. Not a soul in sight. I felt like a stranger in a world I didn’t belong in. I felt like a criminal out of jail but then at that moment something struck my heart harder than fear. I had realized that my parents were supposed to pick me up after school had ended. What did they do when they didn’t find me? Did they go and look for me as If I were lost or did they go home and expect me to show up as If I were not worth the search? I was starting to believe that what Elma was saying before was true. 
   
     I headed towards the middle of the building, where the auditorium slept. The auditorium hadn't been updated since the building was constructed in 1932. The paint on the podium was peeling, and the tiled floors were starting to show serious age. It was reeked with wet wood, and it generally gave me more memories of discomfort than anything. Large red curtains covered the windows, and I was in awe as the blankness of the room started to blind me. I left the auditorium; I had only gone there to quench my curiosity, but I certainly regretted it afterwards.
   
     I had finally found the doors that lead to the exit I would normally go out of. It was two large brick colored doors with glass windows on the top and bottom. I walked through those doors with a certain relief that I was no longer where I wasn’t supposed to be. But then at a moment's notice, there was nobody, there was nothing. It was empty, not my parents or any officials. Nothing, there was nowhere for me to go. Of course, I could go home and relinquish my state of being lost but that wasn’t the issue. It is that I am unknowingly lost. I am forgotten.
