   content:`Florida nights are almost never cold. Although one night in my youth the Florida air was cold as New York in the fall. I was perched on my dad’s shoulders, shivering as the cold air condensed my breath in front of me. As we walked, I laid my eyes upon a waterpark after hours. The inflatable tubes were still floating across the “lazy river”. The lazy river had large plastic red-topped mushrooms sitting beside hills as decorations. At day time, they would be relaxing and fun furniture for the ride but at night it casted an eerie sense of not belonging.

   Although I felt unnerved by the deserted water park, I said nothing and we silently made our way back to the hotel. After we had reached our room, something didn’t sit well with me. I felt as if that waterpark had a significant meaning to it or something horrifying had happened to make it so empty.
   
   Years later, I came down with a bad fever that left me in limbo between half-consciousness and delirium. My mother stripped me of all my clothes and threw me on the cool couch. I laid there feeling the emanating heat on my skin. Despite feeling exposed, I had felt like I had spent the entire day out in the scolding sun. I eventually gave way and drifted off to sleep.
   
   I started to dream of a place similar to the waterpark complete with the same large plastic red-topped mushrooms that were placed along the river. The sun had set and although the sky was beginning to be dark, the park was well lit. Despite its intended atmosphere, there weren’t any people at the park. There actually weren't any signs of life there, there was no litter or left-behind belongings. It didn’t have the typical signs of abandonment, the place was obviously kept up with running water but it felt like nobody had been here before, at least not for a while. 
   
   I decided to walk up to the plastic mushroom tree and feel it. Despite its plastic appearance the stem had a coarse texture that gave easily under my hand. Looking up at the cap there was nothing but darkness, I wondered if there was a clear volume to the cap or if it was just hard to see past the void. 
   
   The water running through the river was an unnatural perfect crystal blue and It put me off. I moved away from the water's edge and continued along the riverbank. The plastic mushroom trees stopped appearing and it was just hilly grass from there on out. 
   
   Suddenly I notice a sign posted next to the water. Its placement is innocuous to the continuity of the river but it certainly didn’t make much sense to have it there. It was a white sign with bolded text in the center of it. It was very similar to a Speed Limit Sign in the United States. At first the text was illegible, then out of seemingly nowhere it said “You are Alone.” I continued my journey along the river without thought.
   
    I had noticed that the night sky was reflecting off the water (with the very little light there was). I went on my knees and tried to see my own reflection. I saw nothing, I might have blended in with the night sky(for it being so dark) but I atleast should've seen my own shadow. For a moment I thought I was dead and entered my own hell. I got up and moved along the river.
   
   Eventually the river curved along a big hill where a house was sitting on. Just like the park, the house was mysteriously lit and its color was clear. It was a sharp gray one story house with a roof that faced the sides of the house(as if a child were to draw a house). 
   
   I hadn’t paid attention to the grass, but as I climbed the hill, I noticed the grass wasn’t real. It was the same fake grass they use at golf courses near the hole. It was fake, bright green, and soft on my feet. 
   
   The windows looked black, but I could see the reflection of the river and sky in the glass. The door had no concavity in its texture, it was extremely flat but the normal groves and divots were painted on. Even the door knob was a mere painted illusion. The door would only look right from one angle and one angle only. Despite the evidence that this house is just a prop I try to push on the fake door to see if it would hinge open. The texture of the door felt like wrapping paper and it easily gave way to my push. 
   
   It was completely black, there wasn’t any trace of light, any discernible silhouette and it reeked of cardboard. I put my left foot in first and immediately fell into a void. My entire vision was filled with black and I felt the wind brace against my face. My mouth was open but it was impossible to breathe. I closed my eyes tight in fear and then as If it weren’t happening at all, I was no longer falling. I was on my feet.
   
   The room was lit up by one warm light bulb. The concrete walls and floor were weathered with wear and tare. In between these small holes there was graffiti and writing throughout the entire room. All in red paint. Some words were screaming while others were calm. I tried to focus on a few markings at once : “Empty”, “Nobody”, “Understand”, “Unaccepting”, “Alone”, “Enjoyless”, “Solitary”, “Force Withdraw”. 
   
   I shortly discovered that there weren't any doors, any hatches, or escapes. It was air-tight like a glass container (but now made out of concrete). I frantically searched, jutting my head in all sorts of directions. The words started to grow and suffocate me and the concrete. The concrete was now covered in one big red mess. Before waking up, I focused on a white blotch on the red wall. It was the sign I saw earlier: “You Are Alone.”
